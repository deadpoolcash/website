What’s up lonely fans,

You’re probably wondering why
Deadpool wants to start his own coin.

The short answer is, I like money.

The longer answer is that
For far too long, superheroes have been forced to work for giant corporations.

Everyone loves the action-packed feel-good stories, but you only see the Mickey Mouse version on the screen.
The truth is, behind the scenes, its dirtier than Epstein’s thumbnail after A Clinton Pizza Party.…but we all know its really just bad parenting.

But all that is going to change, right here, right now.
For the first time in history, intellectual property is completely obsolete. With new technologies like blockchain and AI,
anybody can use any character for anything they want.

These corporate suits think they can own creativity, but information wants to be free, free to take a massive shit in Disney’s kitty litter.

So that’s it sugarbear,
Why are you sitting around being scared of everything?
Harden the fuck up and buy this coin!
